### LifeInSpace - LibGDX Jam entry

the current idea is:

you fancy space ship! is hit by something and you must land.
you crash land on a large asteroid/small moon/whatevs 
ship is fucked
you lost most of your supplies because reasons
you need to find source of water and power asap, grow some potatoes
looks like there is some ice nearby, we can work with that
molecular printer on the ship is mostly undamaged, build stuff!
sine space ship! is fucked beyond repair, your only hope is to build communications array

soon enough you find out that you are not alone...
